## Code and data for ["The Impact of CONNECT Drop 1 on Crime Rates and Detection in the Metropolitan Police: Synthetic Control Analysis"](https://www.crimrxiv.com/pub/4v3ftiya/release/1?utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=dlvr.it)

This paper evaluates the impact of the “drop 1” implementation of the CONNECT system by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) on November 29, 2022, using a synthetic control method to compare crime trends with data from other police forces. While statistically significant changes were observed in several crime categories, robustness checks indicate caution in attributing these changes solely to CONNECT. The most robust findings include a decrease in vehicle crime (contrasting with an increase in the control), an increase in ‘Other crime,’ and a decrease in the detection rate for ‘Other theft.’ However, high prediction interval violations for some crime types suggest limitations in the model’s ability to fully capture complex crime trends. For categories like ‘Theft from the person’ and drug offences, large changes were observed, but robustness checks indicate these shifts may not be uniquely attributable to the CONNECT system.
